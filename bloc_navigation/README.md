# bloc_navigation

Shows how to navigate in response to events, as most samples only show navigation via UI interaction.

An event is generated by the BLoC, via a stream of `Action`s. This stream is subscribed to in the 
main Screen's `State` - in its `initState` override. This way the `Navigator` call can be
made from the `Widget` - not the BLoC.

The event isn't a broadcast stream like the buttonEnabled stream, as for events we want them to be
single shot - so events aren't fired more than once.
